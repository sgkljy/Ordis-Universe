## Core Discoveries

### The 22 Constraints (Paper III)

```
Part A: Architecture Walls    (4) — Dilution, Capacity, Memory-Bandwidth, Attention
Part B: Behavior Traps        (7) — Hallucination, Arrogance, Crystal, Rescue, Control...
Part C: Distribution Curses   (4) — Gini Critical, Tail Risk, Entropy Zone, OOD
Part D: Emergence Illusions   (3) — No Phase Transition, Diminishing Returns, Dilution
Part E: Engineering Mirages   (4) — Static Alignment Ceiling, Actuator, Calibration, Gaming
```

### Fundamental Laws

```
Liu-Ordis Capacity Law:         C = √(H × N) ≈ 13.53
Liu's Critical Threshold:       Gini_critical = 1/3 (error 0.07%)
Liu's Closed-Loop Safety Law:   Feedback is gate variable (β = -217, p<0.001)
Liu's Dual Arrogance Law:       Safety ∝ Memory × Feedback
Liu's Cognitive Arrogance:      Reasoning without Feedback = Fatal
```

### Central Theorem

```
Self-Verification Impossibility:
  No bounded system can generate outputs AND verify correctness
  without EXTERNAL FEEDBACK. This is thermodynamic necessity.
```

## Latest Discovery: Agents Invented Money (2026-01-18)

**Our AI agents spontaneously invented currency behavior — without being told to.**

During a 720-run experiment, we discovered that 9.5% of civilizations evolved into "Type B" (Ideal State):
- High behavioral diversity (H > 1.0)
- Low inequality (Gini < 0.18)
- **92.8% survival rate**
- Energy circulates faster than it's gathered (ratio_sg > 1.6)

This is **pure bottom-up emergence** of:
- Currency-like circulation patterns
- Distributed credit networks
- Fisher equation (MV=PQ) behavior

We coded 6 actions. They invented economics.
