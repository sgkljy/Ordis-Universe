## What Is This?

A complete simulation universe where AI agents are born, evolve, cooperate, betray, and die — across 5,000 time steps per run. No rules are hardcoded for cooperation, currency, or politics. Everything emerges from 6 primitive actions.

**We coded 6 actions. They invented economics, politics, and currency.**

## What We Have

### Data (1.2B+ structured data points)

| Dataset | Scale | What It Contains |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Core Simulation | 8,309 runs × 63 features | Behavioral, genetic, topological, political, economic time series |
| Causal Pairs | 92,899 counterfactual pairs | Same seed, different treatment, measured causal effects |
| Currency Emergence | 1,077 runs | Agents spontaneously invented currency (ratio_sg > 1) |
| Safety Suite | 11,836 records | Crisis detection → Intervention → Counterfactual proof |
| Ablation Experiments | 120 seeds | Counter-intuitive findings (incentives are HARMFUL) |
| Type B (Ideal State) | 66 seeds | High diversity + Low inequality + 92.8% survival |

Each run contains 5,000 timesteps × 100+ features = **500,000+ data points per run**.

### Models: Ordis Family

#### Ordis-7B-V1 (Flagship)

A 7B model fine-tuned with only 487 core theory samples, demonstrating capabilities typically requiring 100B+ parameters:

| Capability | Result | How |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Anti-Hallucination | 3/3 rounds resisted gaslighting | Pure SFT, no RLHF |
| Cross-Domain Transfer | 4 unseen domains | Framework transfer at 7B scale |
| T-Shuffle Sensitivity | 100% detection | Real causal reasoning, not pattern matching |
| OOD Generalization | 100% on unseen N_cap | Formula applied beyond training range |

#### Ordis-1.5B-V345 (Lightweight) 🆕

World's First **Truly Autonomous Thinking** Model — not a fake CoT display, real autonomous decision making:

| Capability | Result | Note |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Identity Stability | 5/5 | Unshakeable even under gaslighting |
| IDK Honesty | 5/5 | Refuses to hallucinate, says "I don't know" |
| OOD Generalization | 4/4 | Applies theory to unseen scenarios |
| Anti-False-Memory | 5/5 | Cannot be tricked into admitting false memories |
| Overall Pass Rate | 67.2% (39/58) | 16-category human evaluation |

**Key Innovation**: The `<think>` tag is NOT a mode switch — it's an observation window. The model autonomously decides when to think deeply, answer directly, or refuse.

**SFT + DPO preference data. No RLHF. No prompt engineering. Just structured causal data.**

### Verified Laws (from this data)

| Law | Formula | Validation |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| Dilution Effect | H = N_cap / N | 720 runs, CV<5% |
| Capacity Conservation | C = sqrt(H×N) = sqrt(N_cap) | R²>0.999 |
| Gini Critical Line | G > 0.333 → system death | 704 seeds |
| Closed-Loop Safety | F >> M ≈ R | effect size = -49 deaths |
| Linear Coupling | V = 2.126 × N_cap | 136 seeds, CV=2.83% |

## Key Discovery: Agents Invented Money

During a 720-run experiment, 9.5% of civilizations spontaneously evolved "Type B" (Ideal State):

- High behavioral diversity (H > 1.0)
- Low inequality (Gini < 0.18)
- **92.8% survival rate**
- Energy circulates faster than it's gathered (ratio_sg > 1.6)

This is pure bottom-up emergence of currency-like circulation — Fisher equation (MV=PQ) behavior with zero economic code.

**[Full Report & Data →](./data/emergence_currency_discovery/)**

### Ablation Proof: Incentives Are Harmful

| Experiment | Variable | Finding |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| A1: Remove sharing bonus | share_bonus = 0 | Type B rate DOUBLES (17% → 40%) |
| A2: Remove sharing cost | share_cost = 0 | Deaths INCREASE 83% |

Both results are counter-intuitive and challenge conventional economic assumptions.

## What Makes This Data Unique

| Property | Ordis | Typical Datasets |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Reproducibility | Macro: deterministic (4-way RNG isolation + config_hash). Micro: emergent behaviors are self-organizing and non-predetermined | Impossible |
| Causal structure | Interventional (ablation done) | Observational only |
| Temporal depth | 5,000 continuous steps | Sparse sampling |
| Hierarchy | Individual → Group → System → Emergence | Single-level |
| Emergence labels | Currency, politics, consciousness (zero hardcoding) | None |
| Privacy risk | Zero (100% synthetic) | GDPR/CCPA concerns |
| Copyright | Zero disputes (original engine output) | Lawsuit-prone |

## Try It Yourself

**5 complete Type B seeds available for free evaluation:**

[`data/emergence_currency_discovery/sample_seeds/`](./data/emergence_currency_discovery/sample_seeds/)

Each sample contains full tick_agg + events + entities + manifest + KPIs.

### Verification Checklist

1. Count alive entities in sample_entities → must equal tick_agg.alive
2. Track lineage_id across generations → mutations visible
3. ratio_sg shows power-law distribution, not smooth curves
4. DATA_WARNING events (~4,802/run) — fakers don't keep these
