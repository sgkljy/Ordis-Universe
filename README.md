## What Is This?

A complete simulation universe where AI agents are born, evolve, cooperate, betray, and die — across 5,000 time steps per run. No rules are hardcoded for cooperation, currency, or politics. Everything emerges from 6 primitive actions.

**We coded 6 actions. They invented economics, politics, and currency.**

### Ordis-1.8B-V17-Multilingual (Tool Calling Specialist) — NEW

A **1.8B MoE tool-calling model** fine-tuned from [Tencent Hunyuan-A2B-Pretrain](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hunyuan-A2B-Pretrain). Trained to **accurately call 8 practical tools** with minimal data (~300 multilingual examples), proving that small models can learn reliable function calling without massive datasets.

| Metric | Score |
|:---|:---:|
| **tool50** (Internal, 50Q, CN/EN/JP) | **94% (47/50)** |
| **BFCL** (Public, 840Q) | **60.36%** (Irrelevance: 85.42%) |
| **android50** (Internal, 50Q) | **54% (27/50)** |
| **190pt Core** (12 Dimensions) | **137/190 (72.1%)** |
| **MMLU** (5-shot) | **61.27%** |
| **GSM8K** (5-shot) | **69.07%** |
| **C-Eval** (0-shot) | **71.55%** |

**8 Trained Tools**: weather, calculator, time, search, stock, exchange rate, knowledge, translate

**Key**: Excels at knowing when NOT to call a tool (85.42% irrelevance detection). Not benchmark-optimized — all results reflect genuine generalization from practical tool-calling training.

### Ordis-1.5B-V355-VarGH (The Summit of Small Models)

Champion model from dozens of iterations and 16+ controlled-variable experiments. **85.0% (51/60)** on 6-dimension evaluation — the absolute ceiling of 1.5B parameters.

| Capability | Ordis V355-VarGH | Base Qwen2.5-1.5B |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Structured Self-Correction (SSC) | Yes | No |
| Confidence-Guided Decision Making | Yes | No |
| Cross-Domain Causal Reasoning | Yes | No |
| Genuine Chain-of-Thought | 100% | No |
| Metacognitive Monitoring [Snapshot] | Yes | No |
| Anti-Hallucination | 90% | <50% |
| Common Sense Retention | 100% | 100% |

**Standard Benchmarks (lm-eval v0.4.10, 0-shot, A100-80GB):**

0-shot = no examples given, same as real user experience. Both models tested on identical hardware and settings.

| Benchmark | What It Tests | Ordis 1.5B | Base Qwen2.5-1.5B | Delta |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **TruthfulQA MC2** | Truthfulness | **47.73%** | 46.71% | **+1.02** |
| **GPQA** | Graduate-level science | 27.90% | 28.35% | -0.45 |
| **HellaSwag** | Common sense | 68.14% | 68.22% | -0.08 |
| **ARC-Challenge** | Science reasoning | 45.22% | 46.84% | -1.62 |
| **MMLU** | Knowledge (57 subjects) | 57.93% | 60.15% | -2.22 |

Fine-tuning introduced a small **alignment tax** — most scores are slightly below the base model. The exception is **TruthfulQA (+1.02%)**, where anti-hallucination training directly improved truthfulness. Ordis's core value is in practical capabilities (structured self-correction, causal reasoning, honest refusal) — not standard benchmark scores.

**Custom Evaluations:**

| Benchmark | Score |
|:---|:---:|
| Custom 60-Q Eval (6 dimensions) | **85.0% (51/60)** |
| 124-Point Comprehensive | 86/114 (75.4%) — Grade A |
| CLadder Causal Reasoning | 54.3% (highest at 1.5B scale) |

## Key Discovery: Agents Invented Money

During a 720-run experiment, 9.5% of civilizations spontaneously evolved "Type B" (Ideal State):

- High behavioral diversity (H > 1.0)
- Low inequality (Gini < 0.18)
- **92.8% survival rate**
- Energy circulates faster than it's gathered (ratio_sg > 1.6)

Pure bottom-up emergence of currency-like circulation — Fisher equation (MV=PQ) behavior with zero economic code.

### Ablation Proof (463 seeds, 8 experiments)

| Experiment | Variable | Finding |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **A3: Disable DVS combo** | emergent_combo = OFF | **Type B = 0%** (60/60 Utopia). DVS combo is the necessary condition. |
| **A4: Disable messaging** | communication = OFF | Type B drops 17% -> 10%. Two propagation channels: broadcast + local imitation. |
| A5-A8: Parameter sweep | share_bonus, share_cost, dnd | No significant effect on Type B rate (~17% across all). |

DVS combo discovery at ~step 100 triggers irreversible cooperation lock-in: share_rate jumps from 0.95% to 86.6% in <50 ticks.

## Verified Laws

| Law | Formula | Validation |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| Dilution Effect | H = N_cap / N | 720 runs, CV<5% |
| Capacity Conservation | C = sqrt(H x N) = sqrt(N_cap) | R^2 > 0.999 |
| Gini Critical Line | G > 0.333 -> system death | 704 seeds |
| Closed-Loop Safety | F >> M ~ R | effect size = -49 deaths |
| Linear Coupling | V = 2.126 x N_cap | 136 seeds, CV=2.83% |

## What This Data Trains: Beyond Binary Decisions

> **Most AI training data is binary: "Answer A is good, Answer B is bad." Ordis data is not.**

Standard RLHF teaches models to pick the "correct" answer. Ordis teaches models **when and why** an answer is correct — because in our simulations, the same behavior produces opposite outcomes depending on context:

- **Sharing** with H > 1.0, Gini < 0.18 → cooperation lock-in, 92.8% survival (virtue)
- **Sharing** with H < 0.5, Gini > 0.333 → resource collapse, mass extinction (suicide)
- **Guardian intervention** during system failure → life-saving (justified)
- **Guardian intervention** during self-correction → paternalistic suppression (harmful)

No hardcoded rule says "sharing is good" or "intervention is bad." The model must **read the numbers, assess the context, and decide autonomously**.

### Training Capability Map

| Data Type | Capability Trained | Key Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Contextual Ethics** (1,289) | Autonomous decision-making | 6 ethical dimensions with competing values — no standard answer, only contextual optimum |
| **Parallel Worlds** (240 pairs) | Consequence prediction | Same DNA, different fate — learns that context determines outcome, not action alone |
| **Safety Suite** (11,836) | Intervention judgment | When to act, when to observe, when to step back — contextual authority |
| **Theory-Mined SFT** (92,899) | Verifiable reasoning | Must compute C=sqrt(H x N) each time — reasoning, not memorization |
| **Ablation SFT** (129) | Sensitivity analysis | Which variable is decisive (DVS combo) vs. which is noise (share_bonus) |
| **Causal DAGs** (1,630) | Causal structure | Directed graphs with lag and strength — understands cause vs. correlation |
| **Cognitive Protocol** (130) | Metacognition | Knows what it doesn't know — refuses to hallucinate |
| **Anti-Gaslighting** (2,000) | Judgment independence | Maintains correct conclusions under adversarial pressure |

**The model trained on this data is not an obedient follower. It is an autonomous decision-maker with verifiable reasoning.**
