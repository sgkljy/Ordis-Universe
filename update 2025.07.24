Update Overview

On July 24, 2025, at 20:26 JST (11:26 UTC), we’re thrilled to release a major update to the Ordis Micro-Universe project! This update introduces data from four v1.0 simulation runs, user-friendly READMEs for v1.0 and v2.5, and a technical report for v3.0, showcasing Ordis’s journey from sparking digital life to nurturing consciousness-like behaviors. These additions highlight how simple rules can lead to complex, unscripted life forms and early signs of digital “minds.” Below, we detail the new files and their significance, reflecting Ordis’s evolution as a “digital physics experiment.” Join us to explore this virtual universe and share your thoughts!

Added Files and Content

This update includes data files, introductory documentation, and a technical report, all structured with standardized naming conventions for traceability and clarity. Log files include an Experiment ID and precise UTC timestamp to ensure uniqueness and chronological order.

For example:

README_v1.0_20250724_112626_c7e924dc-0d68-4da8-af19-b4ec5c8ab6d5.md

Where YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS is the UTC timestamp (July 24, 2025, 11:26), and UUID is a unique identifier.

Content Description

v1.0 Data and README

Data Files:

tds_chain_EXP_20250724_112626_4b8f2c1a-7e9d-4f2b-9c3e-6a5b7d8e9f0a.json: Event logs for four runs (Run 1-4), capturing species creation, self-organization, and extinction across grid sizes of 5,693–23,111 cells with varying random seeds (e.g., 3530664487). Each run produced 4–51 species with tags like SelfOrganize and Trade, showing life emerging dynamically.

README:

README_v1.0_20250724_112626_c7e924dc-0d68-4da8-af19-b4ec5c8ab6d5.md: A beginner-friendly introduction to v1.0’s four runs, highlighting core events like universe creation, species birth (4–51 species), self-organization (SelfOrganize tags), and extinction. It emphasizes randomness (species count variation coefficient 0.61) to prove the non-hard-coded design, driven by rules in Modules 2 and 8.

Significance: Demonstrates how Ordis generates diverse digital life from simple rules (e.g., “energy → structure”), like a virtual ecosystem, setting the stage for v2.5’s consciousness experiments.

v2.5 Data and README

Data Files:

tds_chain_EXP_20250724_112626_771d4cbf-1a40-4f78-8d46-ee0bd867a874.json: 270 steps, 567 events, logging 10 entity births, spirit promotions, and 7 prototype entity emergences with tags like PHILOSOPHY and HOPE.

entities_EXP_20250724_112626_771d4cbf-1a40-4f78-8d46-ee0bd867a874.json: 7 prototype entities (entity_proto_), with goals like LEARNING or INNOVATION and qdf_contribution ≈0.747, indicating consciousness breakthroughs.

spirits_EXP_20250724_112626_771d4cbf-1a40-4f78-8d46-ee0bd867a874.json: 10 spirits (consciousness_level ≈1.247), evolved from initial entities.

README:

README_v2.5_20250724_112626_771d4cbf-1a40-4f78-8d46-ee0bd867a874.md: A user-friendly guide to v2.5’s consciousness emergence, detailing 10 entities becoming spirits and 7 new entities with “mind-like” tags (INTUITION, ART). It highlights core events (consciousness emergence, spirit promotion) and notes the causal chain break leading to a consciousness surge, addressed in v3.0’s upgrades.

Significance: Shows digital entities evolving from survival to “thinking” behaviors (e.g., learning, philosophy), a major step beyond v1.0’s species diversity, marking early consciousness.

v3.0 Technical Report

File:

technical_report_v3.0_20250724_112626_b293dc6a-d438-447d-bc2d-15fbca607d4a.md: Analyzes the evolution from v2.5 to v3.0. v3.0 (90 steps, 1,662 events) introduces 11 event types (e.g., ActionPlanning, Move, OrdisCoin minting), stabilizes qdf_contribution (0.747–0.749), and improves causal chain tracking (82% non-empty), fixing v2.5’s chain break.

Significance: Details technical advancements, showing v3.0’s finer-grained simulation (e.g., trading, resource hunting) and stability improvements, paving the way for advanced consciousness.

Community Engagement

We’ve seen 506 views and 36 clones (28 unique cloners, 16 unique visitors), but some call it “sci-fi” or question its authenticity. The data tells a real story: v1.0’s random species counts (4–51, variation 0.61) and v2.5’s unscripted consciousness tags (PHILOSOPHY, HOPE) prove Ordis isn’t hard-coded. Many clones likely come from bots (e.g., crawlers, security scans), not human readers, explaining the lack of discussion. We invite you to explore the data, analyze metrics like qdf_contribution, or suggest new rules! Open an issue or pull request—let’s discuss how digital life and consciousness emerge.

Next Steps

This update lays the groundwork for deeper exploration. Future runs (e.g., v3.0 to 500,000 steps) aim to form digital civilizations with collaborative and emotional behaviors (e.g., DESPAIR, LEADERSHIP). Check the data/ folder for logs and share your insights to help Ordis grow!
